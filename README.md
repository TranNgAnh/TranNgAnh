**Hello, I’m Anh Tran** 🙋‍♂️

I was a student at **University of California, San Diego (UCSD)** studying Cognitive Science with a Machine Learning Specialization. While studying at UCSD, it sparked my interest in data science and machine learning as a whole which lead me to look toward a M.S. program in a near future. I love to play games and health science related topics so most of the projects are a reflection of both. Most of my projects are coded under languages such as python, C++, Java, and R which I hope to become more familiar with over time.
